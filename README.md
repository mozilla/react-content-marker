# Content Marker for React

`react-content-marker` is a tool to replace content in strings with HTML tags.
It can match simple text, or use the full power of regex.

**Key features:**

- Can replace text with anything (other text, any React node).
- Supports any number of parsers (so you can mark several patterns
  in the same text easily).
- Works on strings and arrays of strings (it ignores non-string items),
  meaning you can combine it with other parsing tools.

## Install

`npm i -P react-content-marker` or `yarn add react-content-marker`


## Basic usage

```js
import createMarker from 'react-content-marker';

const parsers = [
    {
        rule: 'world',
        tag: x => <mark title='Target'>{ x }</mark>,
    },
    {
        rule: /(hello)/i,
        tag: x => <mark title='Greeting'>{ x }</mark>,
    },
];

const MyMarker = createMarker(parsers);

render(<MyMarker>Hello, world!</MyMarker>);

// Renders:
<mark title='Greeting'>Hello</mark>, <mark title='Target'>world</mark>!
```


## Advanced usage

`react-content-marker` exposes only one function: `createMarker`. It takes
a list of parsers and returns a React component. That component only accepts
a string or an array of strings â€” if you pass it a React Component, nothing will
happen.

Parsers are simple objects. They must define two attributes: `rule` and
`tag`. `rule` is either a string or a regex expressing what is to be matched
in the content. `tag` is a function that takes the matched content and returns
a React Node (a string, null, a React Component, etc. ).

You can use as many parsers as you want. However, note that once a part of your
input has been marked by a rule, it will be ignored for all following rules.
That means that the order of your parsers is very important.

When using regex, you will need to have at least one pair of capturing
parentheses, as that is what is used to extract the matched content. If your
regex is complex and uses several capturing parentheses, by default this library
will choose the last non-null match available. If you want to match a different
group, you can define a `matchIndex` attribute in your parser. That integer
will be used to choose the captured group to return. Here are examples:

```js
// Without `matchIndex`.
const parsers = [
    {
        rule: /(hello (world|folks))/i,
        tag: x => <mark>{ x }</mark>,
    },
];
const MyMarker = createMarker(parsers);
render(<MyMarker>Hello, world!</MyMarker>);

// Renders:
Hello, <mark>world</mark>!
```

```js
// With `matchIndex`.
const parsers = [
    {
        rule: /(hello (world|folks))/i,
        tag: x => <mark>{ x }</mark>,
        matchIndex: 0,
    },
];
const MyMarker = createMarker(parsers);
render(<MyMarker>Hello, world!</MyMarker>);

// Renders:
<mark>Hello, world</mark>!
```

### The `mark` function

You can also directly access the `mark` function. That can be useful if you
need to combine different stacks of parsers, and don't want, or cannot, just
merge the lists of rules (which should almost always be a better and simpler
solution). For example, if you want to create a Higher-Order Marker that
combines with another Marker.

`mark` takes the content to mark and all properties of a rule as parameters,
and outputs the marked content as an array of strings and React nodes.
See its definition:

```js
function mark(
    content: string | Array<string | React.Node>,
    rule: string | RegExp,
    tag: (string) => React.Node,
    matchIndex: ?number,
): Array<string | React.Node>
```

Note however that this function doesn't perform some of the niceties
`createMarker` does. For example, it doesn't automatically add a `key` to the
tagged elements, which might create warnings in your code.
